Pathline Analysis (Simulation type = 2)
Forward tracking (Tracking direction =  1)
Let particles pass through weak sink cells (Weak sink option = 1)
Let particles pass through weak source cells for backtracking simulations (Weak source option = 1)
Reference time will be calculated for: Period      1 Step      1
The relative time position within the time step is = 0.0000000
Computed reference time =   0.0000000E+00
Extend initial or final steady-state time step and continue tracking (Stopping time option =  2)

A zone array will be read.
Particles will be terminated when they enter cells with a zone numbers equal to     2
